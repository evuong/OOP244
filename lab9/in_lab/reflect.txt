1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.

It will not compile, it will give an error. It is because the template <typename T> is not the same type of declaration as a function. The "T" will not be defined for the templated function in the .cpp file.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

I moved an entire templated function, including its declaration into the .cpp file and it worked. Nothing else needed to be changed.


3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?

Yes it could have been done by overloading functions with integer and double arguments. By using templates, the code is more concise by grouping both types of overloaded functions into a single template. It is less work and easier to read. 

4. Are the following equivalent?
     template<class T>
     template<typename T> 

Yes.
