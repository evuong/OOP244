1. What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
A namespace is a scope definition that defines a block of code. Its purpose is to prevent conflict of similar variable names within a program.

2. Why are header files needed? Explain.
Header files are used to create the prototypes of a function. Prototypes are used to declare a function and its parameters. 

3. In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but
not the .h files. Explain why you donâ€™t compile header files.
Header files do not have any running code. They only have declarations and prototypes. They cannot compile whereas .cpp files contain a main and code. 

4. Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
Because when a source file (.cpp) is included, it basically copies that code into the main run program. It copies the definitions more than once and can lead to duplication and linking errors.  

5. Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.
I learned how to create my own namespaces. How to enclose blocks of code into them and then declare that I am using them.
