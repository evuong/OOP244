1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
The operator does not return a Fraction reference because it is a post-fix operator. This returns a copy of the current object before any of the changes take place, since the original data is not to be modified. 


2. List the temporary objects in the w5_at_home.cpp main module.
There are many temporary objects such as:(a+b).display, (b+d).display, (b+=d).display, etc.

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize code duplication.
In the overloaded operator functions, I made simplifications by calling a previous overloaded operator function. For example, in the != operator, I used the == operator and so on.

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I have learned how to use overloaded operators and what their purpose is for.
