4. True or False: is the following definition for main valid? Explain.
      int main() {
        Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}
True, this will be valid. The Hero constructor will run with the name, health and attack and create Hero classes based on Achilles and Hector. 


5. True or False: is the following definition for main valid? Explain.
      int main() {
       (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5))
*
(Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));
}
This one is also valid. Each of the Hero classes are valid inputs and thus it will run with the constructor and operator.
