1) Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
If it doesn't check then it might delete the data currently held which makes it empty.

2) List examples of how you avoided code duplication.
I made a function that checks if the phone number is valid so I can always just run that program.

3) List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
I have learned how to use long long more. Also, I have learned how 'delete' properly to deallocate memory to make room for new.
